    <h2>What is Flogic?</h2>
    <p>
If you use Logic with VoiceOver
 and you want to speed up your workflow, then you've come to the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flogic makes available a set of extra key commands which help you get work done way quicker in Logic. For example, How do you adjust the volume of a track? Maybe, you, interact with the track in the track header, VO left/right to the volume slider, interact with that and then change it. Maybe, you like to open the mixer or use the inspector, int eract with the channelstrip, find the fader, interact with that and then change it.  
    </p>
    <p>
Well, how does press command up or down arrow to turn the volume up or down sound? Way easier than all that interacting right? Or, how would you find out which plugins are on a track? How about pressing 1 to find out what's in the first slot 2 for the second etc? I hope you'll agree, that's way easier than opening the mixer and interacting with the channelstrip.  
    </p>
    <p>
    This is just a taste of what's ins store for you when you become a Flogic user. So, if you haven't tried it yet, what ar you waiting for?
