                Getting started with Flogic
            </h1>
            <p>
                Gettinh up and running with Flogic is a 3-step process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firsly, you'll need to install an app called Keyboard Maestro. This App enables Flogic to understand
                which keys you're pressing when using Logic and to take action based on those keys.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, you'll need to install Flogic itself
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, you'll need to make a few changes to Logic's look and feel and you'l be all set.
            </p>
            <h2>Installing Keyboard Maestro</h2>
            <p>
                To install Keyboard Maestro, grab the free trial of the Keyboard Maestro application from <a
                    href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main">This link</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've got it, copy it in to your applications folder and open it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If using Keyboard Maestro for the first time, please check the boxes for both Keyboard Maestro and
                Keyboard Maestro Engine in system preferences, under “Security and Privacy”, “Accessibility.” These must
                be enabled for Flogic to function correctly.
            </p>



            <p>
                Keyboard Maestro is limited by a 30-day trial period. After this time, a purchase of a one-time license
                is required to continue using the program, and subsequently, Flogic.
