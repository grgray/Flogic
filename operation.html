                How to use Flogic
            </h1>
            <h2>
                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                First up, Kudos to Chi Kim and the flo tools team who layed the groundwork for this project. If you've
                used Flo Tools before, then read the section below entitled "The heart of Flogic" then, you may want to skip straight to the <a href="reference.html">Full list of key commands</a>, and get going. Otherwise, keep reading
                right along.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Your first steps in Flogic
            </h2>
            <p>
                Right, so you've learned that you can turn Flogic on and off with shift slash. This enables you to use
                Flogic with whatever keymap you're currently using with Logic and Flogic won't get in the way of it,
                just turn it off with shift slash whenever you need to. You'll particularly need to do this when you want to
                type, to name a track for example.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flogic has some general key commands most of which use the command key in combination with the function
                keys. These are shown below.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can speak the position of the playhead with command f1. <br>
                You can speak the left and right locators with command f2 and command f3 respectively. <br>
                Speak the playhead position in hours minutes and seconds with command F4. <br>
                Speak the division value with command f6. <br>
                Speak the tempo with command F7. <br>
                Speak the time signature with command F8 <br>
                Speak the current display mode with command F12. <br>
                increase the tempo by 10bpm with option equals. <br>
                Increase the tempo by 1bpm option shift equals. <br>
                Decrease the tempo by 10bpm option minus. <br>
                Decrease the tempo by 1bpm option shift minus. <br>
                Turn replace on or off ctrl shift r. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Although Logic already has a key to turn replace on or off, (numpad  slash by default), pressing this key
                doesn't let you know whether you've just turned it on or off wheras pressing ctrl shift r does tell you
                that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flogic enables you to double tap some keys. Fore example, try double tapping command F8 quickly. This
                enables you to use the menu to change the time signature. Like wise, double tapping command F6 enables
                you to change the division value by opening the division menu. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You will see this double tapping feature throughout Flogic.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Working with tracks
            </h2>
            <p>
                Flogic has some features which will help you work faster with tracks. You can speak the name of the
                selected track by pressing the t key. You've already learned that you can use command up and down arrows
                to change the volume of a track. You can also use command left and right to effortlessly change the pan
                of a track. Pressing the v key will speak the volume of a track and pressing the p key will speak the
                pan.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can adjust the volume and pan in smaller increments by adding the option key. Option command left
                and right arrows adjusts the pan by 1. Likewise, option command up and down arrows adjustss the volume
                by the smallest amount possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can reset the pan to the center by double tapping the p key and you can reset the volume to unity
                gain by double tapping the v key.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can speak the input of the track with i and the output of the track with o. and, double-tapping these keys drop the respective menus enabling you to select the input or output of your track without having to interactwith the channelstrip.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another cool feature of Flogic is that when you press the left and right arrows to move to the regions
                of a track, region names are spoken as they are selected. I've wished Logic did that for the longest
                time and now with Flogic, it does! You can also press the e key to speak the name of the selected
                region.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flogic also has a split region under playhead feature which you can access with option command t. Pressing this key makes sure that the region under the playhead is selected before splitting it - very useful if you're not sure whether the region that is playing is selected or not. After splitting the region Flogic will announce the name of the selected region so that you know that the split actually happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the playhead is not over a region and you press option command t, Flogic will say "region not selected"
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, you've still got the regular split region by pressing command t, but give option command t a try, I think you'll like it.
            </p>
            <p>
                And, speaking of regions, Flogic allows you to control region gain. You can speak region gain with command g. Double-tapping command g will reset it to unity.
            </p>
            <p>
                You change region gain with command ctrl up and down arrows, and you can change it is smaller increments with shift ctrl up and down arrows.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pressing l speaks the clip level indicator and double pressing l resetes it.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find out the current gain reduction by pressing g.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can speak the current quantize value by pressing option q and you can drop the quantize menu and change by double-tapping option q.
            </p>
            <h2>
                The heart of Flogic
            </h2>
            <p>
                as you've already seen, Flogic uses many key commands to enable you to work efficiently with Logic. We
                know that you've got better things in your life to do than trying to remember endless lists of key
                commands and so in Flogic we took the decision to minimize this by introducing the scope concept.
            </p>

            <p>
                All of the keys you've been using up until now are available in "track scope".Whenever you turn Flogic
                on with shift / or when you start Logic, you're in track scope.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, there are other Scopes you need to know about, the most important of which is "Plugin scope"
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, remember in the overview we said that you can press the 1 key to find out what if any plugins are in
                that slot for the selected track? Well, what we didn't tell you is pressing a number key puts you into
                plugin scope with a completely separate set of key commands.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get back into track scope. Press the t key. That will not only speak the name of the selected track
                but it will also activate track scope.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is going to open up possibilities in Flogic's future without running out of available keys to use.
                So, try this now. press a number key, then press t to get back to track scope.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What scopes are currently available in Flogic?" Glad you asked. Well, at present we have track scope
                which you've seen. Plugin scope which is up next, we have send scope,  EQ scope and Piano Roll scope which you can
                read about below
            </p>
            <h2>
                Plugin scope
            </h2>
            <p>
                No prizes for guessing the plugin scope lets you work with plugins like a boss. Here's how it works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly pick your plugin slot by pressing a number key. If there's a plugin in the slot, you can open it
                by pressing o. Do your thing with the plugin and then close it it with command w in the normal way.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there is no plugin in the slot, you'll hear the word "empty". In that case you can add a plugin to
                the end of the chain by pressing A. You can also change the plugin in the selected slot by pressing c.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bypassing a plugin is achieved with the b key. Pressing the b key will say "enabled" or "bypassed",
                letting you know the bypass state of the plugin. Double pressing b will change the state and either
                bypass or activate the plugin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, pressing the i key enables you to inserta plugin between 2 existing plugins. It always inserts
                the plugin above the selected slot, so, to insert a plugin between slot 2 and slot 3, press 3 to make it
                the selected slot, then press i to add a plugin just before it but after slot 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                remember that these keys only work in plugin scope which is activated whenever you press a number key.
                So, if you want to see which output is assigned to this track, you'll have to get back into track scope
                first by pressint t. Once Flogic as announced the name of the track, you're now in track scope and the o
                key will announce the out put you're using.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Send scope
            </h2>
            <p>
                Send scope acts in a very similar way to plugin scope. You can find out which sends have been set by
                pressing option number keys. Like plugin scope, as soon as you press option and a number key, you're now
                in send scope.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can add a send by pressing A <br>
                You can bypass a send by double pressing B or single press b to see if it's bypassed <br>
                You can change a send by pressing C
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, you can change the send level with command up or down arrows and you can speak the current send
                level by pressing the v key.
            </p>
            <h2>
                EQ scope
            </h2>
            <p>
                EQ scope enables you to work with Logic's channel EQ lightning fast. To get into it, you open a channel
                EQ using the o key from with plugin scope.So, you'll press your number keys until you find where the
                channel EQ is, then you'll press o to open it.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get out of EQ scope, simply shut the EQ with command w.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now for EQ scope to work you need to be viewing the EQ in controls mode. Most VoiceOver users have
                this setup as a default but you can always put your EQ into controls mode by going to the top of the
                window, vo-ing across to the view menu button. Open the view menu and choose controls.
            </p>
            <p>
                To EQ your track, first pick an EQ band using the following keys. A double press of the key will turn
                the band on or off.
            </p>
            <p>
                Low Cut press l <br>
                Low shelf press k <br>
                High shelf press j <br>
                High Cut press h <br>
                bands 1 to 4 press the number keys 1 to 4 respectively <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Next choose what you want to change for your selected band using the following keys
            </p>
            <p>
                Increase the gain using command up arrow <br>
                Decrease the gain using command down arrow <br>
                speak the current gain by pressing g <br>
                Increase the frequency by pressing command right arrow <br>
                decrease the frequency by pressing command left arrow <br>
                Speak the frequency by pressing f <br>
                increase the q by pressing shift right arrow<br>
                decrease the q by pressing shift left arrow <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can add the option key to all of these commmands to change each parameter in smaller intervals. For
                example you can change the frequency in smaller intervals by using option command left or right arrow.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Working with the mixer
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once you've got all of the above workflow enhancements under your fingers, I hope you won't feel the need to open the mixer nearly as often as you used to. However, you'll be glad to know that Flogic works in the mixer window as well, enabling you to quickly adjust all of the channel strips that don't appear in the main window such as aux channel strips, your output and master channel strips etc.
                            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, to get this working, you'll need to open the full mixer window with command2. This is better than opening the mixer tab with x because, when you use command 2, you'll automatically be placed on the channel strip of the currently selected track. If you use x to open the mixer, you'll be taken to the mixer group and then you'll have to interact with it and then you'll have to interact with the mixer layout area, so command 2 is definitely the way to go here. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've got the mixer window open with command 2, you can use vo left and right arrows to get to the channel strip you want to change.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you get to the channel strip you want to change, maybe it's your mix bus or your reverb aux, you can simply use Flogic commands such as command up and down arrows to change the volume or command left and right arrows to change the pan.'
            </p>
            <p>
                The key thing here is that you don't need to interact with the channel strip, simply vo left or right arrow to the channel strip you want, then use Flogic, You'll find that this is a much quicker and easer way to work with the mixer.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Piano Roll scope
            </h2>
            <p>
                Are you using the Piano Roll to edit and compose your MIDI in Logic yet? Well, you'll find it easier to
                do this when using the Piano Roll scope, Which is the Brain child of Liam Hackett who has generously
                contributed this feature to Flogic.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get into Piano Roll scope, you need to open the Piano Roll in full window mode by pressing command 4.
                Pressing p to open the Piano Roll tab will not work.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get out of Piano Roll scope, simply close the Piano Roll window with command w.
            </p>
            <p>
                We would recommend using a full keyboard with Logic and here's one of the reasons why, all of these key
                commands are easily accessible from the numeric keypad. But don't worry if you don't have one because
                we've still got you covered.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what can you do with Piano Roll Scope?
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, you can edit notes. To do this you need to select the notes you wish to change. The easiest way
                to do this is to make sure you've got a MIDI region selected before opening the Piano Roll. However, if
                you've got some MIDI on the track which is not selected, you can interact with the Piano Roll layout
                area to see and select the notes as usual.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, once you've got something selected, you can move through the notes by pressing numpad 3 to move to
                and play the next note or numpad 1 to move to and play the previous note.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've found the note you wish to change, you can transpose the note up by 1 semitone with numpad 8
                or down by one semitone with numpad 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can transpose the note up and down by an octave with numpad + and numpad - respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can move the selected note left or right by the current nudge value by using numpad 4 to move the
                note left or numpad 6 to move the note right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on the keymap you're using, you may find it easiest to set your nudge value by setting it to
                your division value with ctrl option d. In


                flogic, double pressing command f6 will drop your division menu so you can pick the division you want
                from the menu as you may find that key commands have not been mapped to do this in your keymap.

                How about lengthening and shortening the selected note? This can be done with keypad 9 to lengthen and
                keypad 7 to shorten the note. Again, the note will be changed by your nudge value.

                As well as the handy features detailed above, Piano Roll scope still has a few neat tricks up it's
                sleeve. For example, you can Speak the velocity of the selected note with the v key, and you can quickly
                change it with command numpad 8 to increase the velocity and command numpad 2 to decrease it. Add the
                option key to change the velocity in smaller amounts.

                How about using the Piano Roll to compose? Well, you can make a copy of the selected note in the exact
                same spot as the selected note by pressing numpad 5, the point being that this allows you to quickly
                make chords because you can then transpose the copy and build those chords up.
            </p>

                In fact, Piano Roll scope can make major and minor triads for you. Simply select your note and then
                press ctrl numpad 4 and boom, there's your major triad. You make the minor triad by pressing ctrl numpad
                5.
            </p>

                You can also copy the selected note to the next nudge value along, great for creating highhats at 16th
                note intervals. Once you've set your nudge value, simply select your note and then you can repeatedlytap
                numpad 0 to get a string of them spaced as required.
