                Flogic installation and setup
            </h1>
            <p>
                Getting up and running with Flogic is a 3-step process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firsly, you'll need to install an app called Keyboard Maestro. This App enables Flogic to understand
                which keys you're pressing when using Logic and to take action based on those keys.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, you'll need to install Flogic itself
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, you'll need to make a few changes to Logic's look and feel and you'l be all set.
            </p>
            <h2>Installing Keyboard Maestro</h2>
            <p>
                To install Keyboard Maestro, grab the free trial of the Keyboard Maestro application from <a
                    href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main">the Keyboard Maestro home page</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've got it, copy it in to your applications folder and open it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're using Keyboard Maestro for the first time, please check the boxes for both Keyboard Maestro
                and
                Keyboard Maestro Engine in system preferences, under “Security and Privacy”, “Accessibility.” These must
                be enabled for Flogic to work correctly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please note that Keyboard Maestro is limited by a 30-day trial period. After this time, a purchase of a
                one-time license
                is required to continue using the program, and subsequently, Flogic.
            </p>
            <p>
                More information about purchasing a license <a
                    href="https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/manual/Purchase">can be found here.</a>
            </p>
            <h2>Installing Flogic</h2>
            <p>
                You can download Flogic from <a>this link.</a> When you've got it simply run the installer and follow
                the prompts in the same way as you do when installing a regular Mac App.
            </p>
            <h2>Setting up Logic</h2>
            <p>
                There are only 2 things you need to do to get logic setup to use Flogic
            </p>
            <p>
                The first is to make sure that the inspector is turned on. You can do this by pressing i. Logic will say
                either Inspector on or Inspector off. If you've just turned it off, press i again to turn it back on.
                This is important as Flogic won't work with the Inspector turned off.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second thing that is recommended is to display the Control bar in custom mode. This is so that
                Flogic can tell you where the locators are set etc. To do this, open a project in Logic with the main
                window in focus. Uninteract with everything and then
                press Vo home to land on the Control bar. Then drop the context menu by pressing VO shift M and choose
                the Customize Control bar in display menu option.
            </p>
            <p>
                Press VO Home and then VO right arrow until you find the first popup menu. It's just after the Go to
                beginning checkbox.
            </p>
            <p>
                Open that menu with VO space and choose the custom menu option.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last thing you've got to do is to save this as a default for all new projects. So press VO End to
                get to the end of this dialog box and VO Left to the save as default button and press it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right, you're all set now. Press shift / and you should hear Flogic say "scope on." If you don't hear
                anything when you press shift / then restart VoiceOver and try pressing shift / again.
            </p>
